This is a JavaScript app that plots any 3D function (R x R) and constructs the
tangent plane at any point. It is meant as a teaching tool for partial derivatives
and linear approximations.

It is used by a professor at the University of Birmingham.

The app is available online [here](https://anicusan.github.io/graph_tangent/).
